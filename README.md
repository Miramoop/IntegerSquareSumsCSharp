# IntegerSquareSumsCSharp
A C# program that inputs a variable-length list of positive, 
non-zero integer values in the range of 1 to 100 from the keyboard. The program then 
calculates the square of each number and maintains the sum of all the squares of each number 
in the list. The program then outputs the sum of all the squares.
